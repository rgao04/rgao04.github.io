## Favortie CPSC 120 L Labs

Lab 2 part-1
This was my favorite lab because it was our first time actually writing and running code. We learned about string types and how it’s being used with std::. Once the lab was finished, it was interesting to see the code run, because I got to test it with the words of my choice.

Lab 8 part-1
This was a fun lab because it was calculating the average score. The lab started off to be confusing because I didn’t know how to use the loop at the time. But towards the end, I finally get how the loop worked and it was easy to understand. It worked like a calculator when I just insert random numbers and it will return me the average.

Lab 6 part-2
I liked this lab because it showed me how the blackjack game works behind the scenes. I’ve played blackjack online before, and it was interesting to learn about the program that actually runs the game. The lab was a challenge because we had to use if statements and think about all the possible cards while writing the code. But once it was done, it felt rewarding to see the computer deal the cards and determine who won or lost, making it feel much more like the real game.
